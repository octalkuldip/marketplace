                        thrived upon natural foods. We ate foods that had been naturally
                        cultivated and offered by Mother Nature herself. Ever since the inception of industrialization,
                        the way the crops were cultivated has changed. As a result, the quality of our food has become a
                        great concern. eDehati comes forward to address this concern by offering you authentic natural
                        food products grown by certified organic farming practices. We change the notion of commercial
                        farming through sustainable farming practices to not only preserve your health but also the
                        environment. After all, the earth is our only home.</p>
